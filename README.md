## Branches for testing:

- [apolloV2](https://github.com/david-mcafee/appsync-sdk-demo/tree/apolloV2) - uses `aws-appsync` and other AppSync SDK packages that support Apollo V2
- [apolloV3](https://github.com/david-mcafee/appsync-sdk-demo/tree/apolloV3) - uses only `aws-appsync-auth-link` and `aws-appsync-subscription-link` packages that support Apollo V3
